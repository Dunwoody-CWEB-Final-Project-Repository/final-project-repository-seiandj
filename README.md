# CWEB Final Project Repository

This is the repository that hosts the code for my final capstone project.
The project uses primarily PHP to utilize the database and generate the dynamic front-end. I integrated Bootstrap for consistent CSS styling and the database is in MySQL.

Also include a description of your project along with instructions on how to replicate your project and where to find your project on the web.
